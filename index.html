<b>2020 the 404 error year</b>,  Beggining with such a crisis and now just praying for our lives. Well what we <br>
studied in junior grade that nature always balances in some way or the other and now what we get is stay<br>
 home and watch the world save by the heroes who do not wear cape, any suit neither they come with any<br>
  dramatic sounds nor any hi-tech weapon, they  came with some surgeon mask, hand sanitizer, syringes and<br>
   what not, yes they are the doctors and nurses we see in hospital working and giving up their life for us.<br><br>
    Due to this pandemic crisis, schools are trying their best to provide their students education but here <br>
	what a problem lies due to such video calls or meetings there is a huge bandwidth and there are some people <br>
	who are located at remote areas and do not have stable  connections for such facilities and from here our journey started.

<p>
We all know the online schooling as a solution given by schools to teach their students but since everything is <br>
not easily excuted, there are places or childrens who cannot access this facility and due to this millions of children in<br>
 India or other students in world cannot have education because of the problems from the client-side or from <br>
the server-side and some meeting apps are considred as easily breached by hackers and since this is the problem,<br>
  here we come in with our aim to give this facilities to these students as soon as possible.

With a seven member crew it was difficult for us to expand our buissness socially, financially and manually. Thus, we <br>
got help from a lot of NGOs and we thank them for helping us to achieve our goals. In other areas like some parts <br>
of Northern part of South America, Western North America, South East Asia, Central Africa and parts of Europe; <br>
companies like Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and Amazon helped us with spreading our app and sponsoring us,

 to online education by having low bandwidth as compared to online meetings. We know you must be wondering<br>
  that it is secure because of the recent news that Indian government declared zoom unsafe, So we have new <br>
  complex type encrypts and high level authentication, app testing is been analysed by many Red Hat and White <br>
  hat hackers. This app will be launched soon on web servers as it is been sent for some verification. Hope our <br>
  organisation and app will benefit your  online schooling. <b><u>Happy Schooling!!!!!</u></b>
